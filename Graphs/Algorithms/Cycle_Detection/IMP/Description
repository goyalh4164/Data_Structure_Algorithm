we can find the path between the two vertices by using 

1) "haspath(v1,v2)" but it has T.C order for each vertex in 
O(V+E) and in w.c no. of edges can be V(pow2) so it is not good complexity wise

2)"Union-find" algorithm maintains a array of parents ..it has complexity of O(V) only much better than has_path
